3 types of services -cluster IP -with in cluster can communicate 
node-port service-expose on both worker nodes into some non standard  port(ie above 30100 by design )
load-balancer service-which can listen on port 80 (HAproxy and nginx,elasic load blancer)on backend it listen to nodes on 30100 above and send to 80(port forwarding


config-maps
A ConfigMap is an API object used to store non-confidential data in key-value pairs. Pods can consume ConfigMaps as environment variables, 
command-line arguments, or as configuration files in a volume.

A ConfigMap allows you to decouple environment-specific configuration from your container images, so that your applications are easily portable.

apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: wordpressdb-configmap
data:
 dbhost: mysql-service
 dbname: wpdb
 dbuser: wpuser
 dbpassword: DEVOPS12345
 dbrootpassword: DEVOPS1
 
 then apply kubectl on configmap file
 check configmap file by kubectl get configmap
 in deployment yaml files we are referring  environmental  variables from configmap ,the following code represent
    
    - name:WORDPRESS_DB_HOST
    valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: wordpressdb-configmap
              key: dbhost
    - name:WORDPRESS_DB_USER
    valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: wordpressdb-configmap
              key: dbuser
     - name:WORDPRESS_DB_NAME
    valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: wordpressdb-configmap
              key: wpdb
       - name:WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD
    valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: wordpressdb-configmap
              key:  dbpassword
    
    SIMILARLYwe can change for mysql-deployment.
