inorder to run kubectl command we need add/ copy certificate from the file run: cp -prf /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf .kube/config
make sure that .kube is present on current directory if not create file called .kube by run: mkdir .kube  
open nano .kube/config
you can find the credentials  there which were copied into the file
then we are ready to run the kubectl on manager nodes
Run kubectl get pods :it lists the nodes that were running 
inoder to join worker nodes to mater nodes we need to have a token to join the master,it can be created when ever we want by running the following command
kubeadm token create --print-join-command
the cmd wil create a token and can join the worker nodes to manager on port 6443,so manager nodes has to open port :6443 in securitybounds on aws machine
then run the token on worker nodes machines then automatically they will connect to cluster
goto manager node run kubectl get pods we can find all nodes manager and  worker nodes to form cluster
 cluster has created with n number of nodes
kubernetes is responsible for the creation of containers in nodes ie orchestraize nodes in cluster
