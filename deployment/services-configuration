Deployments-controller
A Kubernetes Deployment is used to tell Kubernetes how to create or modify instances of the pods that hold a containerized application. 
Deployments can scale the number of replica pods, enable rollout of updated code in a controlled manner, 
or roll back to an earlier deployment version if necessary. 

service
A Service in Kubernetes is an abstraction which defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them. Services enable a loose coupling 
between dependent Pods.A Service is defined using YAML (preferred) or JSON, like all Kubernetes objects
