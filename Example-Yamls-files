For Ansible, nearly every YAML file starts with a list. Each item in the list is a list of key/value pairs, commonly called a “hash” or a “dictionary”. 
So, we need to know how to write lists and dictionaries in YAML.

There’s another small quirk to YAML. All YAML files (regardless of their association with Ansible or not) can optionally begin with --- and end with .... 
This is part of the YAML format and indicates the start and end of a document.


All members of a list are lines beginning at the same indentation level starting with a "- 
# A list of tasty fruits
- Apple
- Orange
- Strawberry
- Mango

A dictionary is represented in a simple key: value form (the colon must be followed by a space):
martin:
  name: Martin D'vloper
  job: Developer
  skill: Elite
  
  
  More complicated data structures are possible, such as lists of dictionaries, dictionaries whose values are lists or a mix of both:

# Employee records
- martin:
    name: Martin D'vloper
    job: Developer
    skills:
      - python
      - perl
      - pascal
- tabitha:
    name: Tabitha Bitumen
    job: Developer
    skills:
      - lisp
      - fortran
      - erlang
